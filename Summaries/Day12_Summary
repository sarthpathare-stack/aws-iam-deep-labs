Project Summary: STS Chain Analyzer
Educational Purpose
A learning tool that demonstrates how to analyze AWS STS (Security Token Service) assume-role permission chains for security risks. Shows the concept of tracking multi-hop role assumptions across accounts.

Core Function
Analyzes chains of AssumeRole API calls

Detects security issues like long chains and privilege escalation

Calculates risk scores based on chain properties

Identifies cross-account transitions

Key Checks
Chain Length (> 3 hops = risky)

Cross-Account Movements (harder to audit)

Admin Privileges at End (excessive permissions)

Destructive Actions (Delete/Modify operations)

Chain Duration (time-based anomalies)

⚠️ Important Note
This is a concept demonstration only - not a production tool. Real STS analysis requires AWS CloudTrail logs, proper IAM analysis, and integration with security services like GuardDuty.

Educational Value
Shows understanding of:

STS assume-role security implications

Permission chain analysis basics

Risk quantification for IAM

Multi-account security considerations
