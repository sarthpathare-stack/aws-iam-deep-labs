SCP Policy Evaluator + Region Lockdown Engine — Summary

This project is a Python-based simulator that evaluates AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs) against resource requests.
It models how AWS Organizations enforce policy-based restrictions such as:

Region lockouts

Explicit Deny overrides

Action and resource pattern matching

SCP condition checks

Misconfiguration detection

The engine loads SCPs from files/strings, interprets statements, checks matching conditions, and returns a detailed evaluation report with reasons, denying rules, and warnings.
It also includes an example SCP policy and multiple test cases to demonstrate the logic.

Key Features

Parse and load SCP JSON policies

Evaluate actions, resources, and conditions

Simulate region lockdown rules

Support Action, Resource, NotAction, NotResource

Wildcard pattern matching for actions/ARNs

Source IP and region conditions

Misconfiguration detector for overly permissive rules

Built-in interactive testing mode

Example SCP + ready-made test cases

Purpose

This project is designed as a learning simulation to help understand how SCPs work in AWS Organizations.
It helps visualize how denies take precedence, how region restrictions behave, and how policies influence resource creation.

⚠️ Important Note

This project is not production-grade.
It does not fully represent AWS’s internal SCP evaluation engine.
It is intentionally simplified to demonstrate my knowledge of AWS Organizations, IAM, SCP logic, and Python programming.
