Day 9 — Full STS & IAM Evaluation Flow
Why Full Flow Matters
IAM failures rarely come from one policy.
They come from layers interacting.

Simplified Evaluation Order

SCPs (organization level)
Trust policy
STS token validity
Permission boundary
Identity policy
Resource policy
Failure at ANY step → DENY.
Explicit Deny Is Absolute
Cannot be overridde
Stops evaluation immediately
Applies across all layers

Why Debugging IAM Is Hard:
Policies are distributed
Denies may be hidden
Some layers are invisible (SCPs)
Correct Debugging Mindset
Never ask:
“Why is this allowed?”
Always ask:
“Where is it being denied?”

Final Truth

IAM is not broken.
Your mental model usually is.

Once you understand the flow, IAM becomes predictable.
