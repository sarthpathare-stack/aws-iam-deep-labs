Day 6 — STS Temporary Credential Behavior
What STS Really Does

STS does NOT grant permissions.

It only:

Issues temporary credentials

Enforces time-bound access

Acts as a broker

Properties of STS Credentials

Expire automatically

Cannot be renewed indefinitely

Bound to role/session policies

Safer than IAM users

STS Is Always in the Middle

Used in:

AssumeRole

Cross-account access

SSO

Federation

EKS, ECS, Lambda

If STS fails → access fails.

Common STS Failures

Expired token

Clock skew

Invalid session name

Blocked by SCP

Missing trust condition

Debugging Rule

If access worked yesterday but fails today:
Check token expiration first.
