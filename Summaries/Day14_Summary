ABAC Tag-Match Evaluator + Zero Trust Enforcer — Summary

This project is a lightweight Python script that simulates Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Zero-Trust validation using simple tag-matching logic between a user and a resource.

It demonstrates how real-world security engines validate identity attributes (user tags) against resource attributes before allowing access.

What the Script Does

Loads User Tags
Represents identity attributes such as:

Environment

Owner

Team

Department

Loads Resource Tags
Represents metadata attached to cloud resources.

Applies Matching Rules
Performs exact-match checks for:

Environment

Owner

Team

Detects Mismatches
Lists any user/resource tag differences.

Zero-Trust Evaluation

If all required attributes match → Access ALLOWED

If any mismatch exists → Access DENIED

Outputs a Clean Result
Includes match/mismatch reasoning and Zero-Trust enforcement result.

Key Learning Concepts Demonstrated

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

Identity-driven access controls

Zero-Trust "never trust, always verify" principle

Tag comparison logic

Simple conditional evaluation

Security decision reasoning

⚠️ Important Note

This is not production-grade security logic.
It is a learning simulation designed to demonstrate my understanding of:

ABAC fundamentals

Tag matching

Zero-Trust decision-making

Python-based policy evaluation

The script intentionally keeps the rules simple for educational clarity.
