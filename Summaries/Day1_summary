# Day 1 — IAM Foundations

## What is IAM?
IAM (Identity and Access Management) controls:
- WHO can access AWS
- WHAT actions they can perform
- ON WHICH resources
- UNDER WHICH conditions

IAM is the security brain of AWS.

---

## Core IAM Components
- **User**: A long-term human identity
- **Group**: Collection of users (policy convenience)
- **Role**: Temporary identity assumed by services or users
- **Policy**: JSON document that defines permissions

---

## Authentication vs Authorization
- **Authentication**: Who are you? (login, credentials)
- **Authorization**: What are you allowed to do? (policies)

IAM mostly handles **authorization**.

---

## Why Roles Are Better Than Users
- No long-term credentials
- Temporary access via STS
- Safer for EC2, Lambda, cross-account access
- Industry standard (users are discouraged)

---

## Root User (Danger Zone)
- Root has unlimited power
- Should never be used for daily work
- Only for account-level actions
- Must be protected with MFA

---

## Key Takeaways
- IAM is not about permissions only — it's about identity design
- Roles > Users in real-world architectures
- Security starts with **who**, not **what**
