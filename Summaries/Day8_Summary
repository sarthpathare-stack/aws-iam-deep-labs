Day 8 — Permission Boundaries
Why Permission Boundaries Exist

Permission boundaries solve delegation problems.

They prevent:

Privilege escalation

Over-permissioned roles

Unsafe automation

What Boundaries Do

They:

Do NOT grant permissions

Only set maximum allowed permissions

Effective permission =
Identity Policy ∩ Permission Boundary

Evaluation Logic

Identity policy allows action

Boundary allows action

If boundary blocks → DENY

Explicit deny still wins

Common Misunderstanding

“Boundary is an extra policy”

Wrong.

Boundary is a ceiling, not a permission source.

Where Boundaries Are Used

Secure role creation

Dev teams creating IAM roles

CI/CD pipelines

Multi-team environments
