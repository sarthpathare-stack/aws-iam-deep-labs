Day 7 — IAM Access Analyzer (Visibility, Not Control)
What Access Analyzer Is

Access Analyzer is not an enforcement tool.

It:

Analyzes policies

Detects unintended access

Generates findings

It never blocks traffic.

What It Detects

Cross-account access

Public access

External principals

Broad trust relationships

Why It Matters

Permissions can look valid but be dangerous.

Access Analyzer answers:

“Who CAN access this resource?”

Not:

“Who SHOULD access it?”

Common Misconception

Finding ≠ vulnerability
Finding = visibility

Security engineers decide what to fix.

Best Use Case

Use Access Analyzer:

After policy changes

During audits

When onboarding new accounts
