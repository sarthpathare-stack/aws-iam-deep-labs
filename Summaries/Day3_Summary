# Day 3 — IAM Policy Evaluation Logic

## Why Policy Evaluation Matters
IAM issues do not happen because policies are missing.
They happen because multiple policies interact in complex ways.

Understanding evaluation logic is the key to debugging IAM.

## Core Evaluation Rules
1. AWS starts with an **implicit deny**
2. All applicable policies are evaluated together
3. If ANY explicit deny exists → final result is DENY
4. If at least one allow exists AND no deny → ALLOW
5. If no allow exists → DENY (implicit)

---

## Policies Evaluated Together
AWS does NOT evaluate policies one by one.
It evaluates the **union of all policies**.

Sources include:
- Identity policies
- Resource policies
- Session policies (later)
- SCPs (later)
- Permission boundaries (later)

---

## Deny Always Wins
An explicit deny:
- Overrides all allows
- Cannot be overridden
- Is final

This rule never changes.

---

## Why IAM Feels Confusing
- Multiple policies apply at once
- Permissions look allowed but are denied
- Denies are often hidden in other layers

IAM is logical, not intuitive.
