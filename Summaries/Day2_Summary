# Day 2 — IAM Policies Basics

## What is an IAM Policy?
An IAM policy is a JSON document that defines:
- WHAT actions are allowed or denied
- ON WHICH resources
- UNDER WHICH conditions

Policies do NOT grant access by default.
Everything starts with an implicit deny.

---

## Types of IAM Policies
### 1. Identity-Based Policies
- Attached to users, groups, or roles
- Most common policy type
- Example: Allow EC2 actions for a role

### 2. Resource-Based Policies
- Attached directly to resources (S3, KMS, etc.)
- Define who can access the resource
- Used heavily for cross-account access

---

## Policy Structure
Every policy contains:
- Version
- Statement
  - Effect (Allow / Deny)
  - Action
  - Resource
  - Condition (optional)

---

## Allow vs Deny
- **Allow** grants permission
- **Implicit Deny** exists if no allow is found
- **Explicit Deny** always overrides allow

---

## Important Rule
Policies do not stack like addition.
AWS evaluates them logically.

You must be explicitly allowed.
